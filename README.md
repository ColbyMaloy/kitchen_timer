# timer

A basic kitchen timer app which allows Radial Dragging and snaps to whole minutes. Uses a lot of CustomPainter for the arrow, timer text and notches.

This project was built as a learning experience while coding alongside a Tutorial, which you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svxUUz5mi9s) .

I followed the tuturial, ensuring to understand and absorb the things I was working with - it wasn't mindlessly copied.
